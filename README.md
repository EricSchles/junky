**Bad Data == Bad Analysis**
Junky is a WiP started at PyGotham 2014 intended to one day become a tool to quickly identify potential problems in the distribution and normalization of datasets.

**Tasks**
//Dataset Size//
  - How many records? How much space do we have to examine subgroups?
  
//Normalization of Variables//
  - In columns with string types does the data need to be cleaned to normalize categories

//Normal Distributions//
  - Z-scores and T-tests
  - Max, Min, Mediun, Mode, Mean

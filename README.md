### Bad Data == Bad Analysis
Junky is a WiP started at PyGotham 2014 intended to one day become a tool to quickly identify potential problems in the distribution and normalization of datasets.

### Tasks
_Dataset Size_
  - How many records? How much space do we have to examine subgroups?
  
_Normalization of Variables_
  - In columns with string types does the data need to be cleaned to normalize categories?

_Normal Distributions_
  - Z-scores and T-tests
  - Max, Min, Mediun, Mode, Mean
